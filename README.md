<h1>Social Vulnerability and Toxic Waste</h1>
This was my final project for Interactive Geovisualization, which allows for a multilevel exploration of two primary datasources: the US CDC's Social Vulnerability Index, and the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory.  In this visualization, users are presented with a zoomable top-level map which represents social vulnerability characteristics as a choropleth by county, then overlays proportionally-sized hexagon symbols representing number of TRI sites in that county.  When the mouse is moved over a state, the visual changes persona by changing the hexagon symbols into a dot-density map representing individual sites.  In this way, users can identify areas of interest in the small-scale map, then zoom in and reveal additional detail in smaller areas using the large-scale map.

<h2>Project Features</h2>

///GOT THIS FAR

* Proportional symbol presentation varies size of marker according to probability of sample dating to the year currently in view
* This allows for an intuitive exploration of highly abstract scientific data (sampled radiocarbon probability analysis)
* Supplementals provide contextual information on project scope and interpretation of results
* Supplementals contain appropriate graphics and embedded carousels
* Custom-written timeline and playback controls allow for effortless exploration of data
* Playback controls allow for variations in speed, independent dragging, restarting to beginning when played from end, etc.
* Control panel on right sidebar enables contextual marker highlighting based on sample's recorded archaeological culture identification
* Era and symbol size legend callouts provide additional context to aid interperetation
* Custom Mapbox tileset used to enhance visual contrast of presentation
* Custom graphics and design elements (website background, etc.)
* Full academic attributions are included
