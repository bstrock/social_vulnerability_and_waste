<h1>Social Vulnerability and Toxic Waste</h1>
This was my final project for Interactive Geovisualization, which allows for a multilevel exploration of two primary datasources: the US CDC's Social Vulnerability Index, and the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory.  In this visualization, users are presented with a zoomable top-level map which represents social vulnerability characteristics as a choropleth by county, then overlays proportionally-sized hexagon symbols representing number of TRI sites in that county.  


When the mouse is moved over a state, the visual changes persona by changing the hexagon symbols into a dot-density map representing individual sites.  In this way, users can identify areas of interest in the small-scale map, then zoom in and reveal additional detail in smaller areas using the large-scale map.
